        The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.</h3>

    SHREK
    <p> upon a time there was a lovely 
    princess. But she had an enchantment 
    upon her of a fearful sort which could 
    only be broken by love's first kiss. 
    She was locked away in a castle guarded 
    by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
    Many brave knights had attempted to 
    free her from this dreadful prison, 
    but non prevailed. She waited in the 
    dragon's keep in the highest room of 
    the tallest tower for her true love 
    and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
    Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
    a load of - (toilet flush)</p>

<p>Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
after the ogre.</p>

NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                <p>MAN1
    Think it's in there?</p>

               <p> MAN2
    All right. Let's get it!</p>

               <p> MAN1
    Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
    thing can do to you?</p>

                <p>MAN3
    Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
    bread.</p>

Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                SHREK
    Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
    giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
    They'll make a suit from your freshly 
    peeled skin.

                MEN
    No!

                SHREK
    They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
    jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
    quite good on toast.

                MAN1
    Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
    (waves the torch at Shrek.)

Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
men are in the dark.

                SHREK
    This is the part where you run away. 
    (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
    And stay out! (looks down and picks 
    up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. 
    Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and 
    throws the paper over his shoulder.)</p>
